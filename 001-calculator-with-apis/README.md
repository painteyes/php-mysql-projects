# Calculator with APIs

Reproduce a calculator just using APIs.

Create a list of endpoints to reproduce the operations of Sum, Subtraction, Multiply and Division.

Each API should:

- Accept a list of parameters within the body section
- Be called only with POST method
- Return the result of the operation, and provide an error if the params doesn't match the operation or the operation is not possible
